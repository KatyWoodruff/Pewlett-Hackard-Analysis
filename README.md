# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
### Analysis Overview
With a large number of employees from Pewlett and Hackard retiring soon, I have analyzed the employee data to understand the impact of the upcoming loss. While sorting data, it was discovered that a significant amount of management will be reaching retirement age soon and the company will need to replace those vital employees. Management has expressed a desire to create a mentorship program among soon-to-be-retiring employees and employees with enough experience to be able to take on those roles.

## Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
