# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
### Analysis Overview
With a large number of employees from Pewlett and Hackard retiring soon, I have analyzed the employee data to understand the impact of the upcoming loss. While sorting data, it was discovered that a significant amount of management will be reaching retirement age soon and the company will need to replace those vital employees. Management has expressed a desire to create a mentorship program among soon-to-be-retiring employees and employees with enough experience to be able to take on those roles.

## Results

* 65,427 employees will be retiring soon
* 1549 employees qualify for the mentorship program
* 28,134 of the retiring employees are currently in leadership roles
* The ratio of retirees to mentorship qualifiers is 42 to 1

### Summary of Results

Pewlett and Hackared will need to hire a large volume of new employees as the number of soon to be retiring employees is 65,427. This will significantly impact the company.
The company's plan to mentor upcomming employees should be successful as there are 42 retiring employees per employees who qualify for mentorship.

### Ideas for Improvement Based on Results

There is a large difference in the ammount of employees eligible for mentorship and employees preparing for retirement. I would advise that the pool for eligible employees be expanded to increase the reach of the program, as well as implementing a new hiring program to ensure the company does not suffer as employees hit retirement age.
